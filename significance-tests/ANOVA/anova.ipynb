    "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to **test differences between two or more means**. The name is appropriate because **inferences about means are made by analyzing variance**. We are testing groups to see if thereâ€™s a difference between them. Here are some examples of when you might want to test different groups:\n",

For example, if students from multiple (2+) different colleges take the same standardized test, we can split the populations further by bringing gender into the mix and testing whether there are any meaningful differences in the means of the scores of different genders."
